Despite its simplicity, it seemed that many people found the countdown timer helpful. I received DMs on Discord and Reddit, asking me to add more examinations to the website. So, I decided to expand this project to help even more students.

## 🎯 Making it work

"I initially started the project using Svelte, but quickly realized my mistake and switched to Astro within a few hours of the hackathon starting. The development process with Astro was smooth, except for the usual CSS

The project is complete as its main feature is working, but adding smaller features would be the cherry on top.

Building the project amidst board examinations was a challenging task, but also a fun and insightful experience.

## 🌻 Ensuring the importance of FOSS

It was great interacting and just watching the FOSSHack community, it was a great way to step into FOSS development

## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
├── public/
│   └── favicon.ico
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   └── Card.astro
│   ├── layouts/
│   │   └── Layout.astro
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
